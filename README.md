# bash-text-based-game-engine
This 'engine' allows you to create your own stories and worlds, and then play through them in a bash terminal! Allowing you to add people, items, actions, and adjacent rooms, the possibilites are endless. There is a simple default 'world' with just a handful of things to do for a taste of the possible capabilities.

To run, just ensure both ```game.sh``` and ```input.txt``` are in the same directory, and run ```bash game.sh```.

Capabilities include:

    1. answering questions
    2. situational dialogue (can change on the fly)
    3. interaction with any part of a world
    4. questions that can be asked only once, ***or*** many times (as desired)
    5. situational naming of any part of a world
    6. multiple possible storylines
    7. item 'detection'
    8. availability coding of items/actions to be viewable but not interactable, etc.
    9. situationally available actions


To Do:
    -add interactability to actions
    -clean up and comment some code
    -write raw text -> engine readable array converters
