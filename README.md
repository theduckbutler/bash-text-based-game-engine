# bash-text-based-game-engine
This 'engine' allows you to create your own stories and worlds, and then play through them in a bash terminal! Allowing you to add people, items, actions, and adjacent rooms, the possibilites are endless. There is a simple default 'world' with just a handful of things to do for a taste of the possible capabilities.

Capabilities include:
    -answering questions
    -situational dialogue (can change on the fly)
    -interaction with any part of a world
    -questions that can be asked only once, ***or*** many times (as desired)
    -situational naming of any part of a world
    -multiple possible storylines
    -item 'detection'
    -availability coding of items/actions to be viewable but not interactable, etc.
    -situationally available actions


To Do:
    -add interactability to actions
    -clean up and comment some code
    -write raw text -> engine readable array converters
